# Point Distance

Given two points P(x1,y1) and Q(x2,y2), write a subroutine that returns the distance betweent those two points - $\sqrt{(x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2}\$.

Assume that all the values are doubles.

The subroutine is executed via a call to [this C function](https://github.com/sirkotal/ARM-Assembly/blob/main/point-distance/point_distance.c)
