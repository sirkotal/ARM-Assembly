# Even and Odd Numbers

Given an **array of integers v[]** and **its size**, write a subroutine that **checks whether there are more even or more odd numbers in the array**.

If there are more even numbers, the subroutine should return the number of even numbers; otherwise, it should return the number of odd numbers, but negative (for example, if there are 4 odd numbers, it should return -4).

The subroutine is executed via a call to [this C function](https://github.com/sirkotal/ARM-Assembly/blob/main/even-odd-numbers/even_odd.c)
