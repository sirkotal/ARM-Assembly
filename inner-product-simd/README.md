# Interval Count

Considering two vectors R and S with n integer values, write a subroutine that determines the inner product of R and S using SIMD instructions.

The subroutine is executed via a call to [this C function](https://github.com/sirkotal/ARM-Assembly/blob/main/inner-product-simd/prodintV_simd.c)
